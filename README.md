## MPR - Wrapper for MicroPython mpremote tool
[![PyPi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mpr)](https://pypi.org/project/mpr/)
[![AUR](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/mpr)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mpr/)

The [mpremote][mpremote] command line tool is used to interact with a
[MicroPython][upy] device over a USB/serial connection. It's an official
part of [MicroPython][upy], well featured, and it works more reliably
than competing tools. However, [mpremote][mpremote] exhibits an
unconventional and slightly awkward Linux command line interface.
[mpremote][mpremote] allows "chaining" of multiple sequential commands
but the vast majority of users merely want to copy/delete files etc and
unfortunately the [mpremote][mpremote] user interface compromises
usability for those most common use-cases. Also, users expect in-built
help for all commands so they can easily see usage and expected
arguments (e.g. like [git](https://git-scm.com/) provides).

So [mpr][mpr] presents an alternative "git-like" interface which wraps
[mpremote][mpremote] and behaves like a conventional Linux command line
tool where only a single command is accepted (although note there are
global options to connect an explicit device and/or mount a local
directory before that command). Unlike [mpremote][mpremote], [mpr][mpr]
always allows you to exploit your shell wildcard abilities to pass
multiple file/directory arguments to commands. Full in-built usage help
is available for the tool, and each of it's commands (see
[Usage](#usage) section below). It also provides a novel shortcut
mechanism to [infer target device directories](#directorypath-inference)
based on where on your local PC you are copying files from or to. There
are a few other nice [features](#compatibility-notes). The following
session shows small examples of [mpr][mpr] in use.

# View the inbuild usage/help for the put command:
$ mpr put -h
usage: mpr put [-h] [-f] [-r] src [src ...] dst

Copy one or more local files to directory on device.

positional arguments:
  src              name of local source file[s] on PC
  dst              name of destination dir on device

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -f, --file       destination is file, not directory
  -r, --recursive  copy local directory recursively to / on device

# Copy all Python files to root on device:
$ mpr put *.py /
cp boot.py :boot.py
cp main.py :main.py
cp package_a.py :package_a.py

# Create package_b dir and copy all package_b Python files:
$ mpr mkdir package_b
mkdir :package_b
$ cd package_b
# The following exploits mpr's directory inference feature, see later section
$ mpr put *.py //
cp file1.py :package_b/file1.py
cp file2.py :package_b/file2.py

# Connect to explicit 1st port, mount local dir, and then import main.py:
$ mpr -d id:0001 -m . exec 'import main'

## Installation or Upgrade

Arch Linux users can install [mpr from the
AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mpr/).

Python 3.6 or later is required. The [mpremote][mpremote] program must
be [installed](#path-to-mpremote). Note [mpr is on
PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mpr/) so just ensure that `python3-pip`
and `python3-wheel` are installed then type the following to install (or
upgrade):

```
$ pip install -U mpr
```

Or, to install from this source repository:

```
$ git clone http://github.com/bulletmark/mpr
$ cd mpr
$ pip install -U .
```

To upgrade from the source repository:

```
$ cd mpr # i.e. to git source dir above
$ git pull
$ pip install -U .
```

## Compatibility Notes

This section describes differences that users transitioning from
[mpremote][mpremote] to [mpr][mpr] should be aware of.

The usage/arguments of individual mpremote commands are not easily
discoverable. mpr overcomes this by providing in-built full
[usage](#usage) help for every individual command:

```
# See overall help:
$ mpr (or mpr -h)

# See help for a specific command:
$ mpr mkdir -h
```

Most mpremote commands are available, but some are implemented in a
different manner. Commands can not be chained, but that is usually only
required for the mpremote `connect` and `mount` commands. In mpr, these
two commands are available as global command line options, not as
explicit commands. So for example, to connect to a specific device and
mount your local directory before importing a module in mpremote you can
do the following:

```
$ mpremote connect id:0001 mount . exec 'import test'
```

The equivalent mpr command is:

```
$ mpr -d id:0001 -m . exec 'import test'
```

All device full path names and mpremote defined shortcut mnemonics can
be used for the `-d/--device` option. For convenience, you can type `mpr
-d list` to print out the standard mpremote device mnemonics and names
which can be used.

The `cp` command in mpremote is implemented with explicit `get` and
`put` commands in mpr so there is no need for the user to use a `:` char
to infer direction.

mpr provides shortcut aliases for the most commonly used longer
commands, e.g. `r` for `repl`, `p` for `put`, and `g` for `get`. See the
main help/usage for a list of all commands and their aliases. E.g,
the command `mpr put *.py /` can instead be tersely typed as: `mpr p *.py /`.

Note that mpr `get` and `put` functions always expect the specified
target to be a directory, so if you want to rename a file when you copy
it then you must explicitly indicate the target to be a file, e.g.

```
$ mpr get file.py newfile.py

# The above will fetch file.py to file.py/newfile.py which is not what
# you want. Add -f switch to specify that the target is a file:

$ mpr get -f file.py newfile.py
```

Commands `mkdir`, `rmdir`, and `rm` have a `-q/--quiet` option added to
suppress normal and error output. E.g. you could use this in a script to
ignore a `mkdir` error when the directory already exists.

The `fs` command is redundant in mpremote so is not implemented in mpr.

`soft-reset` is implemented in mpr as `reset`. Hardware reset is
implemented in mpr as `reboot`. Mpr also adds global options to reset
(`-x/--reset`) or reboot (`-b/--reboot`) after the specified command is
run.

The `cat` command is implemented differently. Instead type `mpr get
file.py -` to pipe a file to standard output.

The `disconnect`, `resume`, and `umount` commands are appropriate for
use with "chained" commands which are not relevant to mpr so are not
implemented.

You can not define shortcuts/macros with mpr, although all the standard
macros within mpremote are available in mpr.

The `mip` command in mpremote currently only offers an `install`
sub-command but `mpr` also offers a `list` sub-command which fetches all
package descriptions from micropython.org and then prints their names,
versions, and descriptions.

There are some undocumented features in mpremote which have been added
to mpr as they are discovered.

1. The `reboot` command can accept an optional millisecs delay.
2. The `put` command (`cp` in mpremote) can copy a specified local
   directory recursively to root (`/`) on the device.

## Default Options

You can set default starting options for your user in
`~/.config/mpr.conf`. E.g. use this to set a default
`--path-to-mpremote` setting so it does not have to be specified each
time. Blank lines and anything after a `#` on any line is ignored.

E.g. create `~/.config/mpr.conf` with contents:

```
--path-to-mpremote ~/.local/bin/mpremote
```

Now you need only specify the command, e.g. `mpr ls` and it will use
that specified `~/.local/bin/mpremote` program.

You can use the `mpr config` command to conveniently change this file
(merely as a shortcut to explicitly specifying your editor and the path
to the file). You can keep commented out configurations for a number of
different settings in your file (e.g. various `--device` and/or
`--mount` options) and switch between them by un-commenting the lines
you want to use.

## Directory/Path Inference

For the following discussion, assume you have a project structured as
follows on your local machine and the same directory hierarchy is used
on your target device.

```
./
├── file1.py
├── file2.py
└── mymodule/
    ├── file3.py
    ├── file4.py
    └── templates/
        ├── file5.tpl
        └── file6.tpl
```

mpr automatically appends the target file name when appropriate, e.g.
if you are sitting in the root of the above tree, you only need to type
`mpr put file1.py /` instead of `mpr put file1.py /file1.py`. For this
reason, you can copy multiple files with `mpr put file1.py file2.py /`
or `mpr put *.py /`. Further to this, mpr can also infer the
appropriate target directory as described next.

If you are currently sitting in the directory `mymodule/templates/` on
your local machine and you want to copy `file5.tpl` to the
`/mymodule/templates/` on the target device then the command you would
naively use is:

```
$ mpr put file5.tpl /mymodule/templates
```

To avoid this verbose typing, you can simply type the following instead:

```
$ mpr put file5.tpl ///
```

To then remove that same file from the target device:

```
$ mpr rm ///file5.tpl
```

I.e., mpr intercepts the two redundant lead slashes for the above two
cases and automatically inserts the parent and current directory names
in the path string (determined from the current directory on your local
machine). To be clear, if you are sitting one level above in the
`mymodule` directory then the command to copy to that same directory on
the target device is:

```
$ mpr put file3.py //
```

You can also use this shorthand for source files/dirs by inserting a
sequence of leading slashes as a "dummy" argument. Once set, that dummy
argument sets the default directory for the following arguments. E.g. if
you are sitting in the local `templates` directory then to delete all
the `*.tpl` files in the same directory on the target you can type:

```
$ mpr rm /// file5.tpl file6.tpl
```
or just:

```
$ mpr rm /// *.tpl
```

Note the 2nd "trick" above exploits the wildcard file list generated by
your shell to pass those local file names to the remote device. It
assumes those same names exist in the analogous directory there (and
arguably this trick should be avoided!).

## Path to mpremote

Many using this program possibly also have downloaded the MicroPython
source tree for building firmware images. E.g. the source installed at
`/opt/MicroPython/` also includes mpremote at
`tools/mpremote/mpremote.py`. So for this reason mpr does not require
mpremote to be explicitly installed as a formal package, nor via
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

The mpr option `--path-to-mpremote` defaults to `mpremote` which will
normally be found by your shell in a standard location (e.g.
`/usr/bin/mpremote`) but if you have the MicroPython source installed
somewhere then you don't need to formally install mpremote and can
instead just set e.g. `--path-to-mpremote
/opt/micropython/tools/mpremote/mpremote.py` in your
`~/.config/mpr.conf` as a [default option](#default-options) as
described in a previous [section](#default-options).

## Shell Tab Completion

If you install the Python 3 [argcomplete](https://kislyuk.github.io/argcomplete/) package:

```
$ pip install -U argcomplete
```

Then mpr will automatically use this to enable [shell tab
completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion) on
mpr commands and options. You merely need to type the following to
source the necessary shell code into your current terminal session (or
add this line to your `~/.bashrc` to enable it permanently):

```
$ . <(mpr -c)
```
